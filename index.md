**Modular Verification Meets xDSL Dynamics**

The modular OBP2 infra-structure provides advanced tools to debug, simulate and model-check your DSL without any transformation.

![Overview](/images/overview.png){:class="center-image"}

OBP is a requirement verification environment, developed at ENSTA Bretagne. The main characteristics are:

- the extensibility of the verification engine, which enables seamless integration of domain specific formalisms like UML, BPMN, TLA+, Fiacre;
- the integration of domain-specific omniscient debugging with model-checking, which bridge the gap between early model diagnosis and formal verification;
- the capacity to decompose the verification problem, which, based on the Context-aware Verification approach, addresses the scalability issues in the context of industrial scale verification.
