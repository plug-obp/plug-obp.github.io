[PragmaDev](https://www.pragmadev.com/){:target="_blank"} released the version 1.0 of [PragmaDev PROCESS](https://www.pragmadev.com/product/process.html){:target="_blank"}, a BPMN process modeling tool, which uses OBP2 for formal process verification.
<!--more-->

PragmaDev Process is a BPMN editor, executor, and verifier. It is the outcome of a 2 years research project with the French Army, Eurocontrol, and Airbus DS. The editor is completely free and the executor offers free execution of small models.

## Property Verification

PragmaDev Process uses OBP2 for property-driven process verification. The properties can be expressed either with the [Property Sequence Charts](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-007-0012-6) (PSC) formalism or with the [GPSL]({% post_url 2019-05-09-buchi %}) formalism.

If the verified property is not satisfied by the process model, OBP2 generates a counter example which is automatically loaded by PragmaDev Process and shown as a layer over the Process model and as a MSC trace.
