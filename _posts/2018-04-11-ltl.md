__Generic Property Specification Language__ (GPSL) is the language used by OBP2 for specifying the properties that should be verified during the analysis (aka LTL for Plug).
As opposed to the [CDL language](http://www.obpcdl.org), GPSL is intended to be **only** a *property-specification* language. Methodologically it should be orthogonal from the formalisms used for *capturing the operational environment* (scenarios) and for *taming the state-space explosion* problem during model-checking (like state-space decomposition (xGDL), pruning (TLA state-constraints), etc.). 

In GPSL each property is associated with a named variable. All these variables form the *property set*
Any subset of the *property set* can be verified during an analysis run.

### Assertions: Syntax & Semantics

There are two Boolean constants predefined in the language: **true** and **false**

Atomic proposition in GPSL are strings of characters enclosed between pairs of `|` (ie. `| string of characters |`). Each atomic proposition can be prefixed with two identifiers specifying the atomic proposition language and the 'verification' module on which it should be interpreted.

### Boolean Operators

Two expressions f and g can be combined using the following Boolean operators

|Operation  | syntax0       | syntax1   | syntax2   | syntax3   | syntax4 |
|---------  |:-------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|
|negation   | not f         | !f        | ~f        |           |         |
|disjunction| f or g        | f \| g    | f \/ g    | f + g     |         | 
|conjunction| f and g       | f & g     | f && g    | f /\ g    | f * g   |
|exclusion  | f xor g       | f ^ g     |           |           |         |
|implication| f implies g   | f -> g    | f => g    |           |         |
|equivalence| f iff g       | f <-> g   | f <=> g   |           |         |

### Let Expressions

To simplify the expression of large formula GPSL uses Let expression forms to 
introduce variables.

```
let
    v1 = expr
    v2 = expr
    ...
    vn = expr
in
    v1 op v2
```

## Temporal Logic: Syntax & Semantics

The support for LTL is enabled using LTL3Buchi conversion [1].

### Temporal Logic Operators

Two expressions f and g can be combined using the following Boolean operators

|operation      | syntax0   | syntax1       | syntax2   | 
|---------------|:---- ----:|:-------------:|:---------:|
| Next          | X f       | next f        | () f      |
| Eventually    | F f       | eventually f  | <> f      |
| Always        | G f       | globally f    | [] f      |
| Strong Until  | f U g     | f until g     |           |
| Weak Until    | f W g     |               |           |
| Weak Release  | f R g     | f release g   | f V g     |
| Strong Release| f M g     |               |           |

## Some examples

```plain
aliceCS			= |{Alice}1@CS|
bobCS 			= |{Bob}1@CS|
exclusionI 		= []!(|{Alice}1@I| && |{Bob}1@I|)
exclusion  		= []!(aliceCS && bobCS)
eventuallyOneInCS 	= []<>(aliceCS || bobCS)
fairness 		= 
	let
		aliceFlagUP=|{sys}1:flags[0] = true|,
		bobFlagUP=|{sys}1:flags[1] = true|
	in 
		 ([]  (  (aliceFlagUP -> (<> aliceCS) )
		      && (bobFlagUP -> (<> bobCS))))  
idling = let
		aliceFlagUP=|{sys}1:flags[0]=true|,
		bobFlagUP=|{sys}1:flags[1]=true|
	in
		([]  (!aliceFlagUP -> (![] aliceCS))
		   && (!bobFlagUP -> (![] bobCS)) )
infoften 		=  [] <> bobCS

all = (exclusion & eventuallyOneInCS & fairness & idling)
```
