**Modular Verification Meets xDSL Dynamics**

The OBP2 infra-structure provides advanced tools to debug, simulate and model-check your DSL without relying on transformations.

![Overview](/images/overview.png){:class="center-image"}

OBP is a requirement verification environment, developed at ENSTA Bretagne. The main characteristics are:

- the extensibility of the verification engine, which enables seamless integration of domain specific formalisms like [UML](bare-metal-uml), [BPMN]({% post_url 2019-11-15-process %}), TLA+, Fiacre;
- the integration of domain-specific omniscient debugging with model-checking, which bridge the gap between early model diagnosis and formal verification;
- the capacity to decompose the verification problem, which, based on the Context-aware Verification approach, addresses the scalability issues in the context of industrial scale verification;
- Language independent property specifications based on the [GPSL formalism]({% post_url 2019-05-09-buchi %}).
