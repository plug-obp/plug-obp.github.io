# Daily Build

Big refactoring of the user interface.

Model-checking :

- it is possible to define a model in the editor directly (for textual specification languages only)
- added a button to run all *verification tasks*
- CSV export of the verification results

Simulation :

- The fireable transitions based on the transition relation
- Button to change the verticality of the simulation trace
- Improvements on the configuration view (expand tree, show only differences)
- Deadlock finding from any configuration
- Added watch expressions on the configurations
- *go until true/false* for groups of watch expressions
