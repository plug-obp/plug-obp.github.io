# v0.0.6

Refactoring of the user interface.
Define a model in the editor directly (for textual specification languages only)

Model-checking :

- added a button to run all *verification tasks*
- CSV export of the verification results

Simulation :

- The fireable transitions based on the transition relation
- Button to change the verticality of the simulation trace
- Improvements on the configuration view (expand tree, show only differences)
- Deadlock finding from any configuration
- Added watch expressions on the configurations
- *go until true/false* for groups of watch expressions

# v0.0.4

Initial model-checking interface and simulation improvements

Model-checking :

- LTL model-checking of GPSL specifications
- Multiple language support
- Counter-example loaded in the simulation view
- Dynamic generation of *verification tasks* based on the specification

Simulation :

- the fireable transitions based on the state-space
- show the difference between configurations
- show configuration details in the traceview
- added generic configuration view, based on a tree

- multi-language
- exploration
- simulation
