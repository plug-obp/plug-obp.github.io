OBP2 new version `0.0.4` is out with tons of new features:

- Exploration:
  - Simulation of models,
  - BFS, DFS explorations,
  - Pause/Resume and stop any exploration,

|![Verification View](/images/obp2/0.0.4/ExecutionDone.png){:width="300px"} | Done execution | 6: Clear results|

- Model-checking:
  - Deadlock verification,
  - LTL verification (See the [post](/properties/2018/04/11/ltl/) on GPSL syntax),
- Advanced simulation view:
  - Tree view of configurations,
  - Differerences between configurations,
  - Configurations filtering with predicates,
  - Graph view of visited configuration,
  - Color coding of duplicate configurations,
  - Presentation of counter-example with possibilty to branch.


### Executions

Plug-OBP alias OBP version 2 is a LTL model-checker for Fiacre models using on the [OBP compiler](http://obp-cdl.org) providing much more advanded model-checking capabilities.
